Since my background isn't directly related to data science, I sometimes find it difficult to fully grasp some of the more technical concepts. I am working hard to bridge the gap in my knowledge, but it has been challenging to keep up with the advanced topics.\\n\\nAs for my research interests, I honestly haven't decided on a specific topic yet. However, my main goal during my master's studies is to build a strong understanding of both the theory and the practical skills required in data science and AI. I hope this will help me feel confident in applying my knowledge and eventually secure a job as a data scientist.\", metadata={'source': 'Challenges-and-Goals.txt'}),\n",
